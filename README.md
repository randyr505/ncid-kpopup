# ncid-kpopup
Contribution to ncid on sourceforge

I wrote this script back in 2007. I wanted to have a popup on my KDE ubuntu server of my caller id and have it speak the number to me. I was using my ubunt box as my ncid server and all of my hacked Tivo's connected to it.

This is part of John L. Chmielewski's awesome ncid project at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ncid/
